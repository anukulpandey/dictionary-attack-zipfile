# Dictionary Attack on ZipFiles

This script is created with the aim that it will be lifesaver if you forget the password of any important zip file.

Make sure that the name of password list file is 'passlist.txt' and name of the zipfile is file.zip, if you use any other extension of the zipfile then the script will throw an error , so make sure to follow the above instructions.

If you try to attack a file which does not have any password then the result will be the first password of the password list.

For better results use Password list with more words. You can create your own wordlist or use an existing one such as RockYou.txt .
